## 🌍 The Story Behind Pata-Space

In Swahili-speaking regions, finding accommodation as a student is a constant challenge. "Pata" means "get" or "find," and we combined it with "Space" to create **Pata-Space** - a platform that helps students find their perfect living space while building a supportive community around them.

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

University students face three critical challenges:
1. **Housing Crisis**: 67% of students struggle to find affordable, safe accommodation near campus
2. **Financial Pressure**: Students spend 40% more on new textbooks and furniture than necessary
3. **Social Isolation**: 1 in 3 students report feeling disconnected from their university community

**Pata-Space is the all-in-one solution.**

- 🛒 **Student Marketplace** - Buy and sell second-hand goods within a trusted community
